# Pose Estimations
This document lists several implementations of pose estimation. 

## Open Pose

State of the art pose estimation but requiring heavy computation. It's not suitable for mobile device.  

## Mobile Pose

Much lighter pose estimation implemetation. It seems working with satisfactory performance in Rasberry Pi but need verification. 

## Chainer Pose Proposal net

This repositroy demonstrates 10 FPS pose estimiation on Rasberry Pi 3.
